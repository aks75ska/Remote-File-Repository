# Remote-File-Repository
This project was developed by me on Visual Studio as a part of Object-Oriented-Design Course in the Spring 2018 semester, Syracuse University

Platform : Windows  
IDE : Microsoft Visual Studio

Contributors -- Prof. Jim Fawcett, Akshay Goyal

The project design is based on Object Oriented Design Principles  

The Project was divided into 4 main parts:  

## Project 1 -> Key / Value Database  
In this project we explored how a non SQL database can be constructed and used.  

## Project 2 -> Software Repository Testbed  
The second project focused on building the core capability of a Software Repository. The Repository is intended to manage a, possibly large, collection of source code packages, providing versioning, check-in, check-out, and browsing.  
We have used the NoSql databased, developed in Project #1, to store metadata about each file in the repository.  

## Project 3 -> Remote Repository Prototypes  
This project focuses on providing the communication channels and Graphical User Interfaces used to implement a Remote Repository, which is developed in Project #4. 
In this project we developed :  
- A C++ message-passing communication system, based on sockets. 
- A Graphical User Interface (GUI) used to send and retrieve packages from the repository, and to request check-in and check-out operations, and view package descriptions, full file text, and package metadata.  

## Project 4 -> Remote Code Repository  
In this project developed a Remote Code Repository, local Client, and communication channel that supports client access to the Repository from any internet enabled processor.
